**VolAtlas** is an open-source quantitative infrastructure organization focused on  
**volatility as a dynamic, cross-asset risk system**.

Rather than treating volatility as a static curve or surface, VolAtlas builds tools
that model how volatility **evolves, destabilizes, and transmits risk across markets**.

---
## 🎯 Mission

To build **research-grade, production-oriented infrastructure** for:

- volatility state modeling  
- model stability and drift diagnostics  
- cross-asset volatility transmission  
- risk-first volatility decomposition  

VolAtlas exists to bridge the gap between **academic volatility models** and
**real-world quantitative trading and risk systems**.

---

## 🧠 Core Philosophy

VolAtlas projects are guided by a small set of principles:

- **Volatility is a state, not a surface**
- **Models drift before they fail**
- **Risk matters more than fit**
- **Interpretability beats complexity**
- **Infrastructure beats signals**

We do **not** build trading strategies.  
We build the **systems that professional trading desks depend on**.

## 🏗️ What We Build

VolAtlas focuses on volatility infrastructure such as:

- implied volatility state representations  
- model ensembles (parametric + non-parametric)  
- rolling calibration and regime diagnostics  
- volatility risk decomposition (level, skew, curvature)  
- cross-asset volatility spillover analysis  

These tools are designed to be:
- modular
- explainable
- numerically robust
- suitable for multi-asset environments

- cross-asset diagnostics  
- risk-focused outputs  

➡️ https://github.com/VolAtlas/volatlas-core

---
### 📚 `volatlas-docs`
Design notes, research explanations, and internal-style memos that justify
modeling and architectural decisions.

---

### 🧪 `volatlas-labs`
Experimental ideas, prototypes, and exploratory research that may later
graduate into `volatlas-core`.

## 🌱 Contribution Model

VolAtlas is designed to be:

- open-source first  
- review-driven  
- research-oriented  

We value:
- small, focused pull requests  
- clear problem statements  
- numerical correctness  
- thoughtful documentation  

Early contributors help shape both **architecture and research direction**.

---

## 🎓 For Students & Researchers

VolAtlas projects are intentionally structured to be:

- **GSoC-friendly**
- suitable for advanced students
- aligned with real-world quantitative research problems

We encourage early discussion, thoughtful questions, and incremental contributions.

## ⭐ Why VolAtlas?

Modern quantitative firms operate on **volatility intelligence**, not just prices.

VolAtlas exists to make that intelligence:
- explicit  
- testable  
- interpretable  
- and open  

If volatility drives risk, then volatility deserves first-class infrastructure.
