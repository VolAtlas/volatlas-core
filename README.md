# 🟣 VolAtlas

**VolAtlas** is an open-source quantitative infrastructure organization focused on  
**volatility as a dynamic, cross-asset risk system**.

Rather than treating volatility as a static curve or surface, VolAtlas builds tools
that model how volatility **evolves, destabilizes, and transmits risk across markets**.
