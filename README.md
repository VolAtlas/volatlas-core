# 🟣 VolAtlas

**VolAtlas** is an open-source quantitative infrastructure organization focused on  
**volatility as a dynamic, cross-asset risk system**.

Rather than treating volatility as a static curve or surface, VolAtlas builds tools
that model how volatility **evolves, destabilizes, and transmits risk across markets**.

## 🎯 Mission

To build **research-grade, production-oriented infrastructure** for:

- volatility state modeling  
- model stability and drift diagnostics  
- cross-asset volatility transmission  
- risk-first volatility decomposition  

VolAtlas exists to bridge the gap between **academic volatility models** and
**real-world quantitative trading and risk systems**.
