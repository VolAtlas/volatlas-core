# 🟣 VolAtlas

**VolAtlas** is an open-source quantitative infrastructure organization focused on  
**volatility as a dynamic, cross-asset risk system**.

Rather than treating volatility as a static curve or surface, VolAtlas builds tools
that model how volatility **evolves, destabilizes, and transmits risk across markets**.

---
## 🎯 Mission

To build **research-grade, production-oriented infrastructure** for:

- volatility state modeling  
- model stability and drift diagnostics  
- cross-asset volatility transmission  
- risk-first volatility decomposition  

VolAtlas exists to bridge the gap between **academic volatility models** and
**real-world quantitative trading and risk systems**.

## 🧠 Core Philosophy

VolAtlas projects are guided by a small set of principles:

- **Volatility is a state, not a surface**
- **Models drift before they fail**
- **Risk matters more than fit**
- **Interpretability beats complexity**
- **Infrastructure beats signals**

We do **not** build trading strategies.  
We build the **systems that professional trading desks depend on**.

## 🏗️ What We Build

VolAtlas focuses on volatility infrastructure such as:

- implied volatility state representations  
- model ensembles (parametric + non-parametric)  
- rolling calibration and regime diagnostics  
- volatility risk decomposition (level, skew, curvature)  
- cross-asset volatility spillover analysis  

These tools are designed to be:
- modular
- explainable
- numerically robust
- suitable for multi-asset environments
